            <p>While accessibility focuses on people with disabilities, many accessibility requirements also improve usability for everyone. Accessibility especially benefits people without disabilities who are in limiting situations, such as using the web on a mobile phone when visual attention is elsewhere, in bright sunlight, in a dark room, in a quiet environment, in a noisy environment, and in an emergency. Accessibility includes both:</p>

                   <p>Requirements that are more specific to people with disabilities — for example, they ensure that websites work well with assistive technologies such as screen readers that read aloud web pages, screen magnifiers that enlarge web pages, and voice recognition software that is used to input text. Most of these requirements are technical and relate to the underlying code rather than to the visual appearance.</p>
                   <p>Requirements that are also general usability principles — which are included in accessibility requirements because they can be significant barriers to people with disabilities. For example, a website that is developed so that it can be used without a mouse is good usability; and use without a mouse is an accessibility requirement because people with some physical and visual disabilities cannot use a mouse at all. In defining accessibility requirements, care is usually taken to not include aspects that impact all people similarly, and only include aspects that put person with a disability is at a disadvantage relative to a person without a disability.</p>
