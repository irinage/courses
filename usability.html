                <p>Usability and user experience design significantly overlap with accessibility when "specified users" includes people with a range of disabilities and "specified context of use" includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies. However, the needs of people with disabilities are often not sufficiently addressed in usability practice and research.

                        Additionally, accessibility includes a technical aspect that is usually not a focus of usability. In practice, basic accessibility is a prerequisite for usability.</p>

                <p>Usable Accessibility
                        Web designers and developers can use usability processes, methods, and techniques, such as user-centered design (UCD) process and user experience design, to address the user interface component of accessibility. While the considerations of people with disabilities are not always included in common practices, they can be easily integrated into existing usability processes, methods, and techniques.
                        
                        A key aspects is incorporating real people in design, including:
                        
                        Ensuring that everyone involved in web projects understands the basics of how people with disabilities use the Web,
                        Involving users with disabilities early and throughout the design process, and
                        Involving users in evaluating web accessibility.
                        Accessibility standards also have an important role in accessible design. For example, understanding the basic Accessibility Principles and using the guidelines for developing early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility so that when users do evaluations, they are able to use the prototype enough to provide useful feedback.
                        
                        Usability processes and user involvement alone cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Accessibility guidelines, standards, and techniques ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered.</p>
